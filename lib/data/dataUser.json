I picked a few that I hoped would come up, and it turned out that\u0026#x27;s what they asked for. I think first a linked list (maybe doubly linked?) and then a tree sort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI surprisingly passed, but the attitude of the interviewer really put me off. He said he knew Python, Java and Go - none of which I had used - and wasn\u0026#x27;t too happy when I said I wanted to use Ruby (which the first guy I spoke to, said was fine). Then throughout the interview it seemed very much like he was fighting against me and trying to prove me wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter that I couldn\u0026#x27;t be bothered any more, I didn\u0026#x27;t really want a job at Google, it\u0026#x27;s just a recruiter contacted me and I decided to try it out. I guess this style of interviewing must work for Google, but it\u0026#x27;s just not the way I like a company to introduce itself to me. It just seems like they are approaching it with so much ego, as if I would be privileged to work there, but to me a job should be mutually beneficial.\u003c/p\u003e",

The answers are dated, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Linux inode is the file system\u0026#x27;s representation of the base info of a file, from which the file\u0026#x27;s data blocks can be found.  It also carries file metadata, but its real function is as the root of the file\u0026#x27;s block index tree. The format depends on the file system. The internal identity of a file is an \u003ci\u003einode number\u003c/i\u003e, not an inode.  What you get from \u0026#x27;stat\u0026#x27; is the file\u0026#x27;s metadata, which mostly comes from the inode data structure on disk, but isn\u0026#x27;t necessarily in the same format.  The formats were the same back around UNIX V7, but there have been some changes in the last few decades as file systems improved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you need to count bits in a word, the first question is whether your CPU has hardware to do that.  NSA always liked population count instructions, which are useful in cryptanalysis, and that\u0026#x27;s why most supercomputers had them since the 1960s.  Now they\u0026#x27;re finally in Intel x86 CPUs with SSE4.2 (added around 2006), which has a \u0026quot;popcount\u0026quot; instruction.[1]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA MAC address \u003ci\u003efor Ethernet\u003c/i\u003e is six bytes.  There are other hardware layer systems, and Google probably uses some of them.

In my opinion, it is better to do well on an interview and decide after the fact that you\u0026#x27;re not interested, than to do a poor job on the interview because you couldn\u0026#x27;t help yourself correcting the other person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor instance during one interview I was being asked questions about a particular topic, and I started to guess that the interviewer didn\u0026#x27;t understand 100% the topic he was asking about.

Second, the questions and expected answers seem biased toward just graduating but smart engineers who don\u0026#x27;t actually have experience to realize the subtleties present in complex systems. The recent lawsuits regarding age discrimination reinforce the notion that this interview setup is biased (intentional or not) toward inexperienced and thus likely younger applicants.

It took me I think something like 30 seconds to come up with it. Think about how you\u0026#x27;d score that (remember: the bar here is \u0026quot;must be more predictive than that dumb trivia question\u0026quot;).

Most people asked a mix of technical and behavioral questions, but one of the interviewers did things a little differently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter we briefly introduced ourselves, he immediately asked me a technical question. I usually talk through the problem and ask for clarifications, he mostly gave me non-answers. I was asked the same question by another company a week or two earlier, so I started writing out code on the whiteboard. At a few points I asked whether or not I should handle an edge case, and every single time he said \u0026quot;yes\u0026quot;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I was done writing all of the code, it took up pretty much the entire board. He asked me - \u0026quot;Why do you have so much code on the board?\u0026quot; and I responded \u0026quot;because I\u0026#x27;m handling a lot of edge cases\u0026quot;. As I recall that was pretty much the end of the interview.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#x27;m generally pretty good at interviewing, so I took whatever he threw at me and just thought he was a little off.

            "text": "\u003cp\u003eEarly in my career I got asked a question about database reporting on sales items and totaling the number by a given date. This was one of the hardest questions I was ever given because I had to \u0026quot;write\u0026quot; the sql out over the phone and was not given a schema so I had to make one up as I went. I was then asked how I would go about writing one that included $0 sales days. At the time I didn\u0026#x27;t know the answer to this -- just that querying for something that doesn\u0026#x27;t exist is not straight forward in sql. I explained that I didn\u0026#x27;t work much with reporting so I had not encountered this solution before and gave a list of possible answers:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e* Generate a complete list of dates in memory and see which do not exist.\n* Create a temporary table to match it up that way.\n* Do post-processing on the report.\n* Research prior art.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was not offered the job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYears later I was given the task of creating a \u0026quot;data warehouse\u0026quot; to enable easy reporting by business analysts so they could stop bothering the engineering team. So, it being the first time I had done this, I read up on different techniques. I solved the problem the previous interviewer proposed by have a table of dates with attributes on them (is weekend, is national holiday, day of week, etc) and all dates foreign key to this table.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, because I couldn\u0026#x27;t think of this solution within a few minutes -- despite it not being in my background -- I did not get the original job from years before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn many ways, I\u0026#x27;m thankful the original interviewer passed upon me. I was able to get a different job that valued being able to think of creative solutions AND being able to research prior art so we don\u0026#x27;t invent a badly designed wheel over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI suspect the author of this article will experience the same feeling with time and it is a real shame companies are valuing root memorization and keyword matching over real problem solving skills.\u003c/p\u003e",

I went on to a phone screen and then on-site interviews, and then the hiring committee. The HC decided that coding\u0026#x2F;algo was strong, but that they needed a stronger \u0026quot;signal\u0026quot; re system design, and to my surprise, scheduled me two more sys design interviews (I did a total of 7 on-sites). I prepared by reading all the Google, Facebook, and Amazon systems papers and did 6 mock interviews with Gainlo, where interviewers all gave pretty good feedback (which led me to believe I wasn\u0026#x27;t a total idiot). When I went to my final Google interviews, I thought I did pretty well except for a couple of TCP\u0026#x2F;IP questions related to checksums and congestion control.  I found those odd because all the prep materials that recruiters sent me listed knowledge of TCP specifics as optional, and this isn\u0026#x27;t my area of expertise anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOddly, one of the interviewers also seemed surprised that I wasn\u0026#x27;t a TCP\u0026#x2F;IP guru (--I bet that now he\u0026#x27;s telling his buddies stories about a candidate who couldn\u0026#x27;t do the SRE equivalent of Fizzbuzz or something similar.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA week later I get the rejection and a long survey containing a link to the job for which they applied on my behalf.

Had I known, I would\u0026#x27;ve studied all about TCP\u0026#x2F;IP and prepared for that level of detail. All that time I thought that I was applying for a general SWE track, and I simply expressed interest to be matched to teams specializing in infrastructure and distributed systems later.\u003c/p\u003e",

            "text": "\u003cp\u003eWow, I had almost the very same set of questions for a junior SRE role! The difference is: I graduated ~1 year ago and therefore have a lot less experience than this guy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was kinda funny, the recruiter called me to \u0026quot;go through some of the questions to see what I will encounter in the actual interview\u0026quot;. I remember, when asked about what Unix function accepts connections on a socket I could just answer \u0026quot;dunno\u0026quot;, because I never used or did that. Even more funny if you consider that they actually came across my profile and called me initially and there is just no place in my CV where I claim such \u0026quot;low-level\u0026quot; knowledge. I also remember that Inode question, \u0026quot;What is stored in an Inode?\u0026quot; - Again \u0026quot;idk\u0026quot; and the answer the recruiter gave was \u0026quot;metadata\u0026quot;. Yes of course metadata, goddammit, what else? (Can an answer really be that simple???)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the interview I felt quite devastated because I did not expect that I had to come up with a solution to process an array with the size of 10,000 in a call with the recruiter. I wasn\u0026#x27;t (and I\u0026#x27;m still not) sure if this was only preparation or an actual interview. In the latter case, I was sure that I failed. Surprisingly however, I was invited to an actual engineering interview some time later.\u003c/p\u003e",

That reeks of sabotage out of spite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen pulls the argument from authority, aggrandizing his accomplishments in an effort to salvage some of his obviously bruised ego.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; Is Google raising the bar too high or is their recruiting staff seriously lacking the skills they are supposed to rate?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeems like Google raised the bar just high enough to weed out the unpleasant personalities. A job interview, even a phone screening, is not \u003ci\u003eall\u003c/i\u003e about technical skill, it is also about soft skills: Is this person a pleasant and communicative person?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; Recruiter: wrong, it\u0026#x27;s file metadata.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; Me: the inode is an index uniquely identifying ...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is where the interview (or at least, this is probably how the author remembered it) went off the rails. Arguing with the recruiter and trying to right a perceived wrong was just plain bad strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom there on out it starts being argumentative, and you can see the recruiter having none of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; Recruiter: Quicksort has the best big-O.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere you can clearly tell the recruiter is just fishing for \u0026quot;correct\u0026quot; answers at this point. Just tell the recruiter with the big-O is here, don\u0026#x27;t be obtuse or difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; Why not let me compare my code to yours in a benchmark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere it turns into a code-measuring contest. Not a very bright idea. By this point in the interview I find this author\u0026#x27;s personality very grating and needlessly argumentative. He can\u0026#x27;t do anything right by now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; We will stop here because it\u0026#x27;s obvious that you don\u0026#x27;t have the necessary skills to write or review network applications.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe recruiter seems to agree with me, but I doubt this is what was said exactly. The conclusion may be similar though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; Maybe Google should have stated that practice is not necessary for the job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe Google does know best what is necessary for the job. Or maybe the author knows, but he is too curt in getting his views across. Not a favourable trait.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is hard to not get salty over a failed job interview. It takes strength of character to not burn bridges and try again in the future with a more pleasant humble approach. Take it as a lesson and move on.\u003c/p\u003e",

Instead, they ask some simple canned questions. The questions may not test essential, first principles sorts of knowledge, but if someone can\u0026#x27;t answer any of them it\u0026#x27;s a bad sign.

I was not selected after 3rd phone interview.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePotential job was about predicting number of servers required or something like that. I was recommended by a friend\u0026#x27;s friend who apparently worked there. Google contacted the day they saw my resume and did two quick phone interviews verifying my basic background.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the third interview which was highly technical, they asked a bunch of techie things including what an inode was. Whatever answer I gave about inode was apparently OK, as the interviewer proceeded to ask me how I would repair a faulty inode.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince I did not know the answer, I honestly said I do know and joked that I would \u0026quot;google\u0026quot; for the answer. My pathetic attempt at humor did not sit well with the interviewer and was told that I did not pass the current interview.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFixing inodes or other hardware\u0026#x2F;software problems is certainly something that needs to be done, but I did not buy the interviewer\u0026#x27;s assertion that everybody in Google knows how to fix inodes. For making predictions about server needs, failure rates are just one factor to consider and the time needed to repair them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether a prediction manager needs to know the low level details of fixing inodes is questionable in my mind. I just assumed that Google interviews a staggering amount of people and reject a large portion of them for the smallest of reasons (like how astronauts are selected). It also seems they hire people for one thing, but that does not preclude them in deploying them in totally different positions. Otherwise there was no reason to ask me techie questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat surprised me was how fast they moved, how upfront they were about overall interview process, and how they asked about non essential questions from my perspective.\u003c/p\u003e",

I work on the FreeBSD kernel and TCP full time.  I know what BDP, window sizing, head of line blocking, etc are way beyond what a typical SRE would and how communication latency would cause major issues.  That confused the questioner.  I can\u0026#x27;t think of anything else I\u0026#x27;d have said wrong, my background is systems engineering and I know more about power distribution, HVAC, and data center design than I care to.  The lady was skeptical of my answers and it felt really humiliating even though I would rate myself more knowledgeable than my questioner, because of the candidate\u0026#x2F;interviewer positioning and failure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next man, on another day, asked me a bunch of math trivia like estimating the angles on the hands of a clock and orders of magnitude guesses of a small item like a marble to fill a room.

No trick questions, just a conversation about what we like to work on.  This was easy because I had an idea of what they have accomplished by their commit logs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost recently I hired two women, masters students, for summer internships.  This was very different because I had no idea what the candidates had done as coursework or projects beyond a simple resume.  I again used casual conversation, no trick questions.  I posed some real world situations, passively seeing if they understood concepts like deadlock, manual memory management, indirection, and had very good working CS\u0026#x2F;OS vocabulary.  This eliminated most of the other candidates, and it was pretty clear who had slogged through their OS and networking classes without passion.  I let each person tell me about projects they worked on which really excited them.  One had done Linux USB driver on her own time, among other interesting things.  The other had implemented a scheduler and file system on a teaching OS as part of her course work.  Both worked out phenomenally and both have patches in the FreeBSD.org source tree from the 2 month internship experience.  I am very proud of this, and of my team for mentoring them so successfully.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe people I hired were often confused; \u0026quot;That\u0026#x27;s it?\u0026quot; at the end of the phone or in person interview.

I have been called by one of their headhunters recently who \u003ci\u003eexplicitly refused\u003c/i\u003e to tell me what sort of position I would be interviewing for. He told me that:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026quot;That is not how we work. We will evaluate your abilities and then, if you pass, offer  you a position on a team that we deem best fitting your skills.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNeedless to say I have thanked him for his time and declined. I am not going to fly to another country to be grilled with stupid coding interviews only to be offered an entry level job on a team I am not interested in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother such thing was an invitation from Amazon\u0026#x27;s HR for an \u0026quot;accelerated testing session\u0026quot; where I was expected to go for a full day of coding tests (together with many others) and then they would pick who they invite for real interviews later where you may learn what sort of position they might offer you. Again, no idea what position\u0026#x2F;job you are interviewing for and wasted entire vacation day - for their convenience. System clearly targeting 20-somethings straight out of school. No, thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe questions from the original article are familiar - but these are often external staffing agencies doing these pre-screens today. Google used to do it in-house with actually technically very competent HR staffers (I have done a few phone calls with someone in their California HQ back in 2002ish), but now if I get contacted by them every now and then it is always an external headhunter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe staffing agencies employees tend to be very technically incompetent. Basically, they often have no idea whatsoever about the technical requirements for the position they are trying to fill. They only match keywords on the CVs in their database (often LinkedIn profiles, etc.) against the keywords in the job description, then they spam everyone that matches with an excited mail about having a \u0026quot;perfect match job\u0026quot;.  The matches are usually on the completely generic stuff like \u0026quot;C++\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Python\u0026quot; that everyone has on their CV, so in most cases the \u0026quot;dream job\u0026quot; is anything but - in a field the person knows nothing about or is not interested in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have been literally hounded for weeks by a headhunter once for a position that I had zero qualification for (Windows\u0026#x2F;.NET stuff - I was mostly Unix guy back then). It finally turned out that she wanted me only because I spoke\u0026#x2F;understood the Czech language. And she fully expected me to move to a \u0026quot;sweatshop\u0026quot; that company had in Czech Republic, trying to do a job I knew nothing about and paying less money that I had as teaching assistant at a university at the time. Some people are just nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe phone screens are the same story - the headhunter has a script provided by their client with a bunch of keywords they are looking for in the answers. They are basically playing bingo with the candidate\u0026#x27;s answers, ticking off the \u0026quot;correct\u0026quot; keywords. Don\u0026#x27;t expect them to actually understand what they are asking. They can\u0026#x27;t - this week they are recruiting a Google engineer and next week they would be trying to fill a civil engineering position and a week later perhaps a chemistry lab technician.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI believe this is exactly what happened here. I have been in a similar situation before myself (not with Google). The hiring managers are complaining about how hard is it to hire talent, but why are they then wasting everyone\u0026#x27;s time with incompetent HR agencies, pointless phone screens that filter out even good candidates and stupid coding tests. Ask for references (I will be happy to provide), ask to see some code at the interview, check my public code (Github for ex), hire for a trial period. But give me a break with this ridiculous testing\u0026#x2F;screening nonsense. Nobody else except software engineers seems to have to put up with this type of crap.\u003c/p\u003e",

Because it\u0026#x27;s the tech equivalent of a lottery winner saying they think the lottery system is a fair and equitable way to distribute money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe same goes for a \u0026quot;I interviewed at Google. It was pleasant, everyone was really nice but sadly I didn\u0026#x27;t got accepted\u0026quot; post.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fact remains, that you don\u0026#x27;t read from \u0026gt;99.99% of people. My interview process was very pleasant. I had a bunch of nice conversations about programming and computers with friendly and humorous people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; Same problem. If you\u0026#x27;re in, you passed the Google employment lottery, so it\u0026#x27;s much more interesting (and should be more meaningful to management) when insiders agree that the hiring process has problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are a \u003ci\u003elot\u003c/i\u003e of insiders.

That would be a hopeless idea from the get-go. The thinking is \u0026quot;there is a hiring bar that we want people to pass and we want to hire exclusively from above that. We don\u0026#x27;t care about the sampling of that, as long as we get that\u0026quot;. What they end up with is a pretty broad sample of that population. Some (like me probably, tbh) just barely pass the bar, some are the very top. Some other top-people got unfortunately rejected, some other barely passing people too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo yes. There is indeed no ambition to actually get just the top 100K engineers in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; All that said, yeah, Google\u0026#x27;s hiring process works for Google. Coming here, to a conversation started by a crappy screening experience, and expecting respect for a process with so many false negatives is a bit optimistic, though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell, mostly I (and DannyBee) are just pointing out obvious flaws in the discussion here. Like the obvious self-selection bias and selective reporting. And the also obvious  fact that this particular post was written while angry and only represents one side of the story; and that not even accurately.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecondarily, in these long-wound comment threads on reddit\u0026#x2F;hackernews\u0026#x2F;twitter, people seem to usually not even be aware of the goals of the hiring process and think \u0026quot;look, here, three prominent false negatives\u0026quot; is an actual argument about the process being flawed.\u003c/p\u003e",

Not at all because it\u0026#x27;s useful knowledge, but simply because if you actually spend time looking at network traffic dumps or ARP tables or DHCP configuration or SLAAC assignments you\u0026#x27;ll be seeing MAC addresses so often that it just becomes obvious. Just like knowing that an IPv4 is 4 bytes and an IPv6 16 bytes. Or that a TCP connection starts with a 3-way SYN\u0026#x2F;SYN-ACK\u0026#x2F;ACK handshake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the same thing applies to the other questions that look like meaningless details: knowing what an inode is and what syscall returns inode data for a path is something that someone with system-level C programming experience should know. stat(2) is far from being something obscure. Knowing what signal is sent by the kill(1) command is maybe slightly more on the trivia side IMO, but it\u0026#x27;s still a very well known fact.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA candidate is most likely not expected to know the answer to all of these questions. But failing in all of the categories is IMO a fairly strong red flag for someone interviewing for SRE, where in general people are usually expected to be comfortable with at least one of {networking, system administration, Linux internals}. In fact, this domain specific knowledge is the biggest differentiator between \u0026quot;standard\u0026quot; SWE and SRE-SWE, even though the lines get blurrier and blurrier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis also indirectly answers this:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; things I would rather have my high level employees looking up rather than relying on a possibly faulty memory\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou would have to be out of touch with the field for quite a while to forget such basic things. Which is likely something that you want to test for in such interviews. To go with a metaphor: if you claim to be a fluent English speaker on your resume, you can\u0026#x27;t be excused of \u0026quot;faulty memory\u0026quot; if you forget how to conjugate \u0026quot;to be\u0026quot; in the present tense. It\u0026#x27;s not something you forget easily, and if you did forget you most likely can\u0026#x27;t say you\u0026#x27;re fluent anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer: I was an SRE at Google for 2.5 years, but I\u0026#x27;m not familiar with the early phases of the recruiting process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[1] \u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;news.ycombinator.com\u0026#x2F;item?id=12701486\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;news.ycombinator.com\u0026#x2F;item?id=12701486\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

It\u0026#x27;s not a set of \u0026quot;high level employee\u0026quot; questions. It\u0026#x27;s a standard SRE pre-screening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026quot;How about the responses from your own employees which are pointing out that they see the problem too. Are they being unreasonable?\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy view of unreasonable is not about whether there is a problem or not.\nIt\u0026#x27;s not about the consensus. I don\u0026#x27;t actually have an opinion myself on the hiring process.  If people i work on recruiting raise problems, i try to solve them. I have not had trouble trying to recruit in general.  So i haven\u0026#x27;t formed a strong opinion, even after 11 years.  If folks want to decide the process is horrible, okay. If folks want to decide it\u0026#x27;s great, that\u0026#x27;s also okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0026#x27;s unreasonable because it\u0026#x27;s both super-quick reaction without time to settle and think, and not aimed at anything other than trying to reinforce one view or the other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNobody is \u003ci\u003eactually\u003c/i\u003e listening to each other, they are just trying to force whatever their view is, good or bad, on others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo to answer you directly, i don\u0026#x27;t think pointing out a problem is unreasonable, but that\u0026#x27;s not my complaint. My complaint is that the actual discussion is not a discussion, but mostly people just arguing on the internet.\nIE You shouldn\u0026#x27;t take me saying \u0026quot;unreasonable\u0026quot; as a proxy for \u0026quot;me saying i think their viewpoint is wrong\u0026quot;.

Customers can own multiple cars. A staff member gets assigned to a car with a work order...) .. draw an ER diagram. This is actually a pretty low stress question. It should be straight forward. If someone draws a terrible ER diagram with lists in tables and no normalization, or unnecessary relationships (or you have to keep asking them to label 1-to-n\u0026#x2F;n-to-1 relationships and they struggle), you know they\u0026#x27;re not going to be good at designing database schemas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother great general knowledge question: \u0026quot;A user types in a web address into a web browser and hits enter.

You can think of it as \u0026quot;ok, I give up. Anything can be passed here, proceed at your own risk, compiler will not save you here, errors will show up at runtime\u0026quot;. Even the memory safe Rust does not do without such unsafe blocks. In dynamically typed languages that is everywhere, though.\nI have said this before: safety benefits of static typing show up when you are working with at least data structures, not simple variables. Imagine you have an external endpoint or library call that is specified to return a single object and does exactly that. At some time after release you are the maintenance programmer responsible for implementing spec changes:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e  * The object returned no longer has member\u0026#x2F;property x, it is obtained by other means;\n  * The endpoint returns list of such objects.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\nHow sure are you that tests in dynamic language cover these cases? My experience shows that tests very rarely get designed to anticipate data changes, because data is driving test design. Which is more likely for a test: a) to test whether object returned contains keys x, y and z; b) to check if the object returned is_list()  (see appendix)?\nStatic typing covers such cases. Static typing is not something that magically saves oneself from shooting them in the foot, but is nevertheless a safety tool that \u003ci\u003eCAN\u003c/i\u003e be used. It is of course a burden if one does not intend to use it and that is the core of the debate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFun thing: in the second case if your code manages to convert input list to a map and assign one returned object to a key that coincides with the removed property and map access looks syntactically the same as property access (a very specific set of assumptions, though), the bug can butterfly quite deep into the code before manifesting :)\u003c/p\u003e",

However, I think they stray from specific language or domain knowledge because they want you to be able to work in different roles, since you don\u0026#x27;t have to interview again to switch teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom what I\u0026#x27;ve read, the idea is to hire people who would be smart enough to learn any specific domain knowledge necessary, because the expectation is engineers might have to tackle problems they wouldn\u0026#x27;t have seen elsewhere. I don\u0026#x27;t really know whether thats true anymore as my impression is now Google just has a bunch of overqualified people though..\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; The problem with that approach is you end up with a very homogenous team of really smart, logical people, but without the balance of more creative, empathic types. Ideally, a well-functioning team will have both, and will have people from many different backgrounds and educations, because that\u0026#x27;s when you get true collaboration and innovation: by mixing unrelated disciplines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan\u0026#x27;t disagree with you there, but its a weird assumption to say that people who are logical are not creative or empathetic. I do think that they hire for \u0026quot;Googliness\u0026quot; whatever that means, which may lead to a monoculture though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn any case, I guess you can call me a Google fanboy. I don\u0026#x27;t agree with everything they do but I feel like bashing Google\u0026#x27;s (or most other company\u0026#x27;s) interview process is the cool thing to do here, but most people  don\u0026#x27;t seem to have tried to understand why it is the way it is, and thus don\u0026#x27;t offer any true alternatives that meet the same goals nor do they reject the goals in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e",

In interview training they tell you the first thing you must do to start an interview is to ask if the candidate would like to get some water \u0026#x2F; use the restroom, then break the ice before starting any questions (applicable also during phone screens).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. Proper interviews actually are supposed to lean heavily toward real-world problem solving approach rather than arcane knowledge. For example, when I interview I look for rational decisions at every turn (not a random example but considering boundary cases, adding a new example to help you visualize the solution should give information gain rather than be something random). My questions are not math oriented, nor do they require deep knowledge of obscure theory. Based on what questions my coworkers ask, I know at least for my team this is not a correct characterization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat we do test for: understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms, ability to thrive in uncertainty (ask clarifying questions! state your assumptions!), ability to break a problem down and solve it from first principles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood interview questions are required to have multiple solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then you have the generalization at the end about creativity and diversity; in my limited experience we seem to get pretty decent diversity and even if there is some homogeneity (we need more women and minorities) it\u0026#x27;s certainly not the kind you described. No, it\u0026#x27;s not a bunch of mathy theory wizards writing code at Google, it\u0026#x27;s way more diverse than that. Not perfect, but not awful like you\u0026#x27;re describing.\u003c/p\u003e",

Which was easy enough but my interviewer wouldn\u0026#x27;t let me finish writing up my implementation and, instead, insisted I focused on optimization of a particular, custom method he asked me to implement. I protested (premature optimization, etc) but ultimately went along with it.

One, is that no one wants to help recruiting, or HR, do their job. Helping them is an errand and is done in a robotic way. You end up with an idiotic checklist that is a shame to great engineers. Second, is when the team finally realizes idiots joining the team are hurting the team - they will go about and have more motivation to support the recruitment process. Then, when you let a group of people devise such a task you get: an average process designed to leave out the human parts (shift bytes in array) and fit each person\u0026#x27;s interview style, or a crazy idiotic processes made by people mentally jerking off to each other (implement raft. in assembly). A team can be a company or an actual software development team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe right way to do it, is this. I believe a single person, who cares about developers, who is passionate about developer experience - should build his\u0026#x2F;her team\u0026#x27;s interview process. He\u0026#x2F;she can take feedback from the team, but that person should eventually build the process and make the calls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this specific case I want to believe there is an accurate answer, and a correct answer, and they wanted the correct answer, or at least to see him negotiate his way to the correct answer even though it is subpar (although his accurate answers are impressive). That being said, I\u0026#x27;m giving Google credit here. There is a small chance it might just be one of the first options I\u0026#x27;ve described here.\u003c/p\u003e",

How many times do I have to say that I have no intent, here? Apply Occam and \u003ci\u003ecui bono\u003c/i\u003e. I don\u0026#x27;t even bloody know who the person is.

Why would I suddenly change gears and attempt to destroy a reputation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am aware people are inundated with rhetoric like this in several forms of media due to the current political climate and other factors, but Jesus, people really need to put their knives away and start challenging their assumptions of the worst in people or we are all royally fucked. That\u0026#x27;s letting the rhetorical climate win. Occam: I\u0026#x27;m a shady person not-so-subtly and rather hamfistedly deploying rhetorical tactics to destroy someone\u0026#x27;s reputation simply for blogging about the Google interview process, or I\u0026#x27;m just a random dude typing things as I find them interesting.

What I will say, in general, is that figuring out what the \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; answers are here for what is obviously a technical phone screen by a non-technical person with answers on a piece of paper is also part of the challenge. This is a Director of Engineering interview. Understanding context \u0026amp; navigating \u0026quot;real people\u0026quot;, having soft skills etc. is meant to be part of the job description. Feels like this gentlemen couldn\u0026#x27;t turn the hardcore engineer off who\u0026#x27;s technically right about everything but yet never seems to get anyone to listen to him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiving the hexadecimal representations of the 3-way handshake... really? You may have gotten a dumb recruiter and you may think you\u0026#x27;re smart, but from my perspective, you answered the questions in a pretty dumb way given the context of non-technical recruiter, very obviously reading answers from a sheet of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#x27;ve done two of these before and I\u0026#x27;ve often said \u0026quot;Oh well, it might be down on your sheet at this thing\u0026quot; and the recruiter goes \u0026quot;Ah, yeh, that\u0026#x27;s it. Tick\u0026quot; and moved through 3-4 questions that in theory I might have gotten wrong. If you take the \u0026quot;be a dick\u0026quot; routine... Congrats. You won the moral war. Best of luck with your next job.\u003c/p\u003e",

At least it was for me, no webcam or anything. It\u0026#x27;s a pretty short and back-to-back question\u0026#x2F;answer type of conversation similar to what is told by the article (although the article strikes me as odd and does not match my experience). After that you have a couple (or more if need) of \u0026quot;phone\u0026quot; (read: hangouts with webcam and shared doc) interviews with actual engineers and those are more technical and require you to write code as well. Then you\u0026#x27;ll be moved to on-site interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(This is for Europe at least, I imagine it\u0026#x27;d be similar in other areas but can\u0026#x27;t know 100%).\u003c/p\u003e",
